            <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups lukewarm water (110째F to 115째F)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 pound low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, grated</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Cornmeal (for dusting)</li>
            <li>Crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, fresh basil, and grated Parmesan (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the bread flour, salt, sugar, and active dry yeast in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add lukewarm water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix with a spoon until a rough dough forms.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5 to 7 minutes, adding more flour if needed, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500째F (260째C) with a pizza stone or heavy baking sheet inside.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half and roll out each piece on a floured surface into a 12- to 14-inch round.</li>
            <li>Spread half of the crushed tomatoes over the rolled dough, leaving a border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half of the grated mozzarella over the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Add any optional toppings such as crushed garlic, red pepper flakes, fresh basil, and grated Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet</li>
            <li>Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is nicely melted and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough, sauce, and cheese.</li>
        </ol>
